# JS-DOS-COLLECTION
A collection DOS games being ran in the browser, duje nukem, doom, digger and more.

# How to run
- As of right now just open the HTML file to play digger, it is that easy! Right now I am wanting to add a front end framework
along with an optional backend to better your navigation of the web application.
